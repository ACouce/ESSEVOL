# ESSEVOL suite, by Alejandro Couce
These codes simulate the evolution of an asexual population exposed to fluctuating selection. Specifically, it tracks the emergence and subsequent dynamics of specialist and generalist mutants. Generalists are classified into two types according to whether they display just a single, compromise phenotype (fixed generalists), or multiple phenotypes (plastic generalists and bet-hedgers). Plastic generalists produce variant phenotypes in response to environmental cues, while bet-hedgers switch between phenotypes in a stochastic fashion. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 750129 https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/209320/factsheet/es

The output is a figure showing the invasion dynamics of several types of mutants: specialist (red), intermediate fixed generalist (cyan), plastic generalist (green) and bet-hedger (magenta and grey).
